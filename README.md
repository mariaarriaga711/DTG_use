# DTG_use
Dolutegravir use is related to lower HTLV-1 proviral load in people co-infected by HIV-1: a cross-sectional study
In this cross-sectional study we quantified HTLV-1 PVL in HIV-HTLV-1 coinfected patients and HTLV-1 mono-infected ones. We compared HTLV-1 PVL across groups, adjusting for age and sex, ART use and CD4/CD8 cells count. 
We used a propensity score derived from a regression model for DTG use and HTLV-1 PVL, that included covariates like age and ART duration.
